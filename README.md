The objective of this assignment is to implement the Surprise Map model developed by Micheal Correll and Jeffrey Heer and use a dataset to come up with our own surprise map. In order to create the surprise map we used the Bayesian model to come up with a hypothesis and then used arithmetic calculations to generate the signed surprise values. By using Python for visualization, we created the choropleth maps to visualize the initial data, our hypothesis, and the final surprise map.
